# Repository & PDF Pipeline

This folder contains all artifacts generated by the autonomous background job that:

1. **Collects** a daily web‑search result (Day 1).**
2. **Summarises** the collected links with the LLM (Day 2).
3. **Converts** the markdown summary into a PDF using `pandoc` (Day 3).
4. **Zips** the entire `project_artifacts/` directory and sends it as a ZIP file (Day 4).

The job runs once per day for four days and then disables itself.  You can retrieve the final PDF (`step_3_report.pdf`) and the ZIP archive (`project_artifacts_repo.zip`) via Telegram messages.
