# Autonomous Repo‑PDF Pipeline – Summary

This short report demonstrates the four‑step autonomous pipeline that:

1. **Collects** data (normally a web‑search).  
2. **Summarises** the collected information.  
3. **Generates** a PDF report from the markdown summary using `pandoc`.  
4. **Packages** all artifacts into a ZIP archive.

All steps are fully automated and the results are sent to you via Telegram.
