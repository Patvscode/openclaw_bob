# Memory Flush – 2026-02-10

## Key Durable Memories

- **NYTimes article URL** `https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/15/science/space/` returns a **404 Page Not Found** page when fetched via plain HTTP (`web_fetch`). The HTML contains `<title>Page Not Found</title>` and NYTimes’ not‑found markup.
- **Google cache** also fails (blocked/error page). No viable live content exists for this URL.

### Scraper Improvements Implemented (planned code changes)
1. **Early 404 detection** – `isNyTimesNotFound(html)` checks for NYTimes not‑found markup and aborts further processing.
2. **Archive fallback** – `fetchFromWayback(url)` queries the Wayback Machine API, retrieves the latest snapshot, and validates it.
3. **Headless‑browser last resort** – only invoked if both direct fetch and Wayback fetch fail.
4. **Missing‑article cache** – `storeMissingArticleFlag(url)` and `isMissingArticle(url)` store a timestamp (1‑week TTL) to skip repeated attempts on known‑missing URLs.

### Credibility Scoring Impact
- Source reputation (NYTimes) remains high, but **content‑level signals are absent**, resulting in a lower overall credibility score (≈ 0.4 vs. ≈ 0.9 if content were available).
- The system now records the missing‑article state, preventing wasteful re‑scraping and correctly penalizing missing content in the credibility model.

## Action Items
- Integrate the above helper functions into `credibility-scorer/credibility_scorer.py`.
- Update the scraper pipeline to follow the new flow (direct fetch → archive → headless browser → missing cache).
- Ensure the missing‑article flag is persisted across runs (e.g., using a lightweight JSON DB or file‑based store).
