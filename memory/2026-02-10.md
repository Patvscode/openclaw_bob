# Memory Entry - 2026-02-10

**User provided a large Base64‑encoded string.**

The string appears to contain a hidden message that answers the question *"What did he get for his birthday?"*.

* The data begins with binary‑looking bytes (`01 00 00 01 ...`) suggesting it is not plain text but possibly a serialized binary format or compressed archive.
* The repeated pattern `ABAAAABAAA...` dominates the later portion, indicating a large filler or possibly an encoded structure.
* No obvious ASCII text (e.g., "He got a ...") is directly visible in the Base64 representation.

**Open questions / next steps:**
1. Decode the Base64 string and inspect the resulting binary (e.g., attempt to treat it as a zip, protobuf, or .NET serialized object) to extract the hidden message.
2. Once the hidden message is revealed, record the concrete answer (the birthday gift) in a concise memory entry.

*Current status:* The raw Base64 has been stored for future decoding; the answer is not yet known.
