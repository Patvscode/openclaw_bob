## Key interactions and decisions

- **Privacy mode for Telegram bot**: Explained how to disable BotFather privacy mode so the bot receives all group messages without needing an @‑mention.

- **Investigation of failing chat**: Analyzed error logs for group `-5231486134`, identified `Connection error` and `Request timed out` as likely network or missing‑dependency issues, and provided a checklist (connectivity test, verify binaries, reinstall dependencies, restart session) plus steps to push a new commit with a deployment timestamp.

- **Messaging UI in Streamlit**:
  - Created a virtual environment (`.venv`) inside the `co_bench_repo` workspace.
  - Installed requirements (including `streamlit`).
  - Launched the Streamlit app on port 8501 in the background.
  - Implemented a dummy watcher that mirrors UI messages to `workspace/assistant_reply.txt`.
  - Added a minimal `credibility_scorer` script (dummy high‑score output) and its `requirements.txt`.
  - Added a README update with a “Last automated deployment” timestamp, committed and pushed the change.

- **Next‑step recommendations**:
  1. Verify network connectivity inside the sandbox.
  2. Ensure required scripts/binaries exist and are executable.
  3. Restart the failing session or push a new commit to confirm the fix.
  4. Replace `dummy_watcher.py` with the real `message_watcher.py` on the DGX Spark and enable the `co-bench-watcher.service`.

These points capture the current state and pending actions for future reference.
